I'm currently a junior at Harvard University studying Math and Computer Science. I'm particularly interested in fields of machine learning, such as NLP, computer vision, and applied deep learning. In addition, I like seeing data science, computation, and statistical thinking applied to a variety of fields, from biology and business to sports and politics. I love discussing new ideas and thoughts; feel free to hit me up with any questions or suggestions!
